# hello-world
My first repository in Github
I'm a coding ameteur with Pyton, but a beginner. 
I want to master this Language and create some amzaing apps to change the world.
Programming is my dream, but I stepped my feet on the wrong road at the beginning of the miracle cyber world.
Now, I hope it is Not too late to catch up what I have left behind these years.
If you are a guru, a master, a hacker, I hope you can give me some advice, please. So I can circumvent the 
obstacles and go straight to the goal in my heart.
Thanks!
